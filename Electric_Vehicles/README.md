# Electric Vehicle Specifications and Capabilities

This project was developed to teach data-analysis techniques aligned with the "Data Analysis with Python" curriculum. It focuses on intermediate and advanced methods in data engineering to demonstrate practical possibilities. Key components include data cleaning, data manipulation and aggregation, feature engineering, statistical linear regression, and working with SQL (creating a database from CSV files and using window functions). Additionally, the project covers best practices for reproducible workflows and dataset documentation.
